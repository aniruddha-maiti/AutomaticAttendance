# AutomaticAttendance
This Python build project uses AI and machine
learning methods to recognize faces. The camera
will click a picture, and that picture will be used to
compare the face with stored face pictures using
the OpenCV face recognition method. When there
is a match, the attendance will be marked in a CSV
file.
